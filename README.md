# UndervaluedPropertyKNN
An R and Python project using K-Nearest Neighbors regression to identify undervalued properties in the Western Cape, South Africa.

## Data Collection 
* Data collection is implemented in Python. 
* The source code of Propery24â€™s website is converted into a string.
* Then using built-in string functions, data on 6575 properties from Cape Town is collected; this includes price (target variable), location, type, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, garage space, and erf size.
* These attributes are stored in a csv file which is saved, for future use in R.
